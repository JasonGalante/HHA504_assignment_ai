# Setup of GCP voice was simple.  Uploaded a voice recording sample (had to change file type to .wav).  Used GUI to upload file and transcribe.
# Could not get GCP Vision OCR working through notebook.  Used theie demo drag and drop option to get a result.  Not sure why this type of gui isnt implemented into the service.
# Setup new ml project in Azure.  Used their tools for OCR to extract text from image.
